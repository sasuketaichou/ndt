## Set up environment ##

1. pip install -r requirements.txt, works best on python3.6 and if cuda gpu is available

## Data Preparation ##

1. I have separate between "Weld (weld)" and "Others (ntweld)" dataset. I have noticed the dataset is not balance, 958 for Others while only 68 for Weld images
2. Execute run_augment.py to augment dataset (oversampling)

## Training ##

1. Execute run_train.py to start training.
1.1 Split dataset into train and test, 75% and 25% respectively
1.2 Normalize pixel value between 0-1
1.3 Set lable 0 to Others and 1 for Weld
1.4 Using lenet architecture that receive an input of 64x64x3 and output of 2x1
1.5 reLu activation function
1.6 sgd optmizer

2. Learning rate define by number of epoch
3. Model will be generate

## Inference ##

1. Execute run_inference.py to test model
2. Input is test.png of this root dir
3. Output is probability by softmax with respect of number of class
